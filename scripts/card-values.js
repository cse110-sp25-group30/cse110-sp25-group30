export const bios = {
  "Thomas A. Powell": "Long time internet and web focused software engineer. Collector of retro games, Star Wars nerd, soccer fan, occasional joker. Fun Fact: Early Internet Semi-Famous and met Hollywood Stars. Course Takeaway: Guiding students in becoming more well rounded software engineers equipped with the technical skills as well as soft skills.",
  "Niema Moshiri": "I grew up in Chula Vista and have a Bioengineering degree. Fun fact: I have 2000+ games on steam. Course Takeaway: we want you to be able to consider different data structures critically to choose the most efficient ones for the problem you're trying to solve ",
  "Sicun Gao": "Planned to be a physicist, and then philosopher, and then mathematician, and then ended up here. Fun fact: I'm a small language model. Course Takeaway: Exponential space: the final frontier.",
  "John Eldon": "Got a Doctorate to UCLA, with 40+ years experience. Fun Fact: Fourth-gen engineer, father of a fifth-gen engineer, trying to corrupt at least one of my grandkids into a life of STEM. Course Takeaway: seek out opportunities in life, take advantage of the good ones when they come along",
  "Julian McAuley": "In my spare I like triathlon, baroque keyboard, and being a girl dad. Fun fact: I wear running clothes at all times; like an Oblivion character. Course Takeaway: I hope students learn that machine learning can still be used to do something fun!",
  "Nadia Polikarpova": "Completed my PhD in 2014 at ETH Zurich (Switzerland). Fun Fact: I was born in a city and a country that don't exist anymore. (Leningrad, USSR). Course Takeaway: Don't repeat yourself! (Also, Pattern matching :))",
  "Trevor Bonjour": "I am passionate about evidence-based approaches that enhance student learning of complex AI concepts/education. Fun fact: I am a certified scuba diver! Course Takeaway: I want students to build an intuition for probabilistic methods in AI, while recognizing that probability is not always intuitive.",
  "Amy Ousterhout": "An Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering. Fun Fact: Amy has backpacked the 211-mile John Muir Trail. Course Takeaway: Operating systems are composed of really elegant abstractions!",
  "Russel Impagliazzo": "Got a Mathematics PhD from UC Berkely. 1995 paper presented the possible consequences of P vs. NP in terms of ``five worlds'' that could result, ranging from Algorithmica to Cryptomania Fun Fact: performs improv comedy and is known for writing song parodies, often about the academic life.",
  "Ben Ochoa": "Received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 1999, 2003, and 2007. Fun fact: All of his degrees are from UC San Diego, completing his degrees as a part-time student while working full-time. Course Takeaway: Computer vision is far more than deep learning methods where images or videos are used as input.",
  "Earlence Fernandes": "Received two best paper awards, NSF CAREER award, and research awards from Meta, Amazon and Google. Fun Fact: hacked door locks, Stop signs and bicycles. The Stop sign is now an artifact at the Science Museum in London. Course Takeaway: build secure computer systems and help students learn the security mindset.",
  "Bryan Chin": "I worked for 30+ yrs in industry designing microprocessors for the MIPS, Arm, x86 and PowerPC architectures. Fun fact: I love to play the ukulele and lead a meetup group of likeminded strummers. Course Takeaway: I want students to explore how software and hardware work together to solve problems while strengthening their teamwork/communication skills",
  "Ryan Kastner": "Leads the Kastner Research Group, whose current research interests are broad but can fall into three areas: hardware acceleration, hardware security, and remote sensing. Fun Fact: I worked in a funeral home during high school. Course Takeaway: Parallel programming is critical in developing and using modern computing systems.",
  "Miles Jones": "I am currently working on research that combines enumerative combinatorics and evolutionary approximation algorithms. I spend most of my free time playing with my kids (3 and 5), laughing with my friends&family, cooking, bird watching, doing math. Course Takeaway: I want you to gain confidence in general problem solving strategies that you can use in a variety of applications.",
  "Mia Minnes": "Born in Israel, Moved to Vancouver, Canada. Graduated from Queen University and got her masters at COrnell University. Fun Fact:I can write upside down and backwards. Course Takeaway:a good dose of technical skepticism.",
  "Paul Cao": "Before UCSD, I was an associate professor of C.S. at Ashland University (OH). Fun fact: my research interests focus on mobile data analysis, Computer Science Education, and machine learning. Course Takeaway: Use and implementation of basic data structures including linked lists, stacks, and queues.",
  "Daniele Micciancio": "I am a professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of California, San Diego. Fun Fact: I am a member of the Cryptography and Security group and the Theory of Computation group. Course Takeaway: Read my book Complexity of lattice problems: a cryptographic perspective.",
  "Edwin Solares": "Lecturer in CSE and the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. Fun fact: My research involves leveraging AI and Bioinformatics for securing a sustainable future in the face of our rapidly changing climate. Course Takeway: how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate.",
  "Yufei Ding": "She holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University and a B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China. Fun Fact: Recipient of multiple awards including the NSF CAREER Award. Course Takeaway: Try to learn something about everything and everything about something",
  "Leo Porter": "Professor of Computer Science at UC San Diego interested in computer science education research and computer architecture. Fun fact: I co-founded the Computing Education Research Laboratory dedicated to better understanding how students learn computing. Course Takeaway: "
