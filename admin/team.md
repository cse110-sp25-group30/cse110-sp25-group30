## Important Values
1. Effort: Always strive to complete your tasks to the best of your ability and in a timely manner.

3. Ask for Help: Donâ€™t be afraid to speak up if you're unsure or stuck. Weâ€™re here to support each other.
4. Support One Another: If a teammate needs help and youâ€™re able to assist, step up and offer support whenever possible.
