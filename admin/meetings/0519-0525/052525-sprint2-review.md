## Task Progress

### #27: 20 Professors Data (Mei, Cody)
- All 20 professors' images and information have been acquired and added onto the project, marking the task as fully complete.

### #48: Clicker Component (Kevin, Aldrin, and Mei)
- Pretty much properly implemented, working as expected, a html page for a clicker that gives you currency points per click and is kept in a local storage value. 
- Requirements left are to implement some style into the clicker to make it more flashy and presentable, adding some small animations and click effects, and maybe some fun bonus details to make it refreshing.

### #49: Shop-Page (Cody, Julia, Jay, Jonathan)
- Pretty much fully implemented and workingas expected. Has a seperate Shop page, in which the person presses a button to buy a pack of cards, complete with an animation of a pack opening, displaying the obtained card and it's rarity. 
- Card rarities implemented alongside this issue, with card rarity being displayed as you obtain the new card. Included is a small bar displaying the percentage for all rarity types
- Requirements left are adding visual flair and some unique finishing touches to the animation (having the animation slightly change depending on the card rarity), making the animations smoother and more stylish, adding the option of buying a more expensive pack with multiple cards.

### #51: Grid View (Aditya, Aldrin, George)
- Grid View displaying all obtained cards pretty much complete, alongside with an animation of the cards appearing on the grid one by one. 
- For now can be accessed through the card deck page on main, but will later on become the main page of the project, as the card deck will be redundant.
- Adding some QoL addition to make the grid less barebones and style (adding a sorting function to sort by rarity of name card, as well as displaying the duplicates under one stack instead of showing them next to each and taking up additional slots).
- Adding a UI Detail of hovering the mouse over for it to enlarge is also necessary, as well as a click function that expands the card to be seen in full detail. 

### #52: Testing (Ali and Mei)
- Not much progress done on Testing Units, due to personal circumstances and lack of time.
- Progress has started right after the end of our review meeting, will focus on implementing the testing throughout next week.

## Additional Progress
- Ali: Finished the CI/CD Pipeline, creating the Phase 2 and adding all of the necessary resources on the repo, as well as hosting the project on a custom Heroku page instead of running locally. Also finalizing the documentation with a JSDocs that automatically updates with new features added and comments.
- George: Further organiztion of the repo, creating status video for the team, adding and updating the main README file with important links and documents.

## Final Notes
- Outside of #52, a lot of good progress has been done on the issues, and most of the expected scope of the project has been pretty much completed in terms of being a card collector.
- Biggest focus for upcoming sprint will be enriching all existing components to be less barebones, as well as adding a consistent and pretty visual style to make it look less bleak, will be discussed more on tommorow's meeting.
