## Retrospective Notes

### GLAD (What Went Well?)
- Effective asynchronous Team Communication throughout Discord Chats on issue details and requirements
- Real-time Screen Sharing between teams led to fast and reliable coding being done with little errors and misunderstandings
- Implementing Psychological Safety by avoiding blame and working on how to improve code and issues
- Listening to team members on their feedback on ways to improve our project components to work better and be more reliable. 
  
### MAD (What Didn't Go Well?)
- Improper contact and communication through Slack on project progress, leading to possible lack of information seen by the TA.
- Personal Circumstances leading to issues with synchronous teamwork (Bad Internet Connection, Emergency Situations)
  
### SAD (What Could Have Gone Better)
- Setting goals and starting on issues earlier for more progress to be made.
- More detailed description of what tasks do and how they should work.
- More detailed documentation comments on what each code aspect does.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to update all of our progress and display it through our Slack as well, in order for the TA to see the progress of our project in real-time conversations.
- Have detailed documentation comments and code for future written code, in order to make the JSdoc have detailed and informative documentization of our code.
