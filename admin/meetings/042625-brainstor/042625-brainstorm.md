## Goals
[x] Brainstorming ideas for the group project that will be worked on throughout the rest of this course. <br>
[x] Coming up with as many card related projects/ideas as possible and narrow it down to the most popular ones by the end. <br>
[] Documenting the Pros and Cons of each popular project idea and how we would go with implementing it. <br>

## Final Notes
> We managed to narrow down all the brainstorming ideas into the top 3-4 popular ones. We will be meeting up once more today at around 5PM to detail the pros and cons of how we would go with designing each idea, and then designing diagrams and flowcharts for the top ideas or the **one** chosen idea we have.
