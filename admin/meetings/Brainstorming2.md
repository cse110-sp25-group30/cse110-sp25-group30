## Goals
[x] Documenting the Pros and Cons of each popular project idea and how we would go with implementing it. <br>
[x] Most of the group managed to vote for the preferred idea to use for the group project, helping finalize an idea of what we are going to go for. <br>
[] Start a rough draft of the Meeting Pitch slides that will be presented. <br>
[] Start creating diagrams and overflows on how we will be proceeding with the chosen ideas. 

Final Notes
> We presented the pros and cons of each idea, and managed to narrow it down to two ideas that will be incorporated together: CSE Professor Card Collector and Flashcards. Combining both aspects would make the project more effective in appropriate scope for a final. For another possible meeting tomorrow, we will try coming up with more flowchart/diagram ideas regarding how we are going to go with the plan, as well as finalizing the meeting pitch slides to make them as informative and efficient as we possibly can.
