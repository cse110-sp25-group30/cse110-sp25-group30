## Task Progress

### #72: Improve Frog-Cards (Jonathan, Cody, Kevin)
- WebP Scaling has been done, making the images load faster and more efficiently. While they are not as high quality, performance is much more necessary to prioritize over the details (Example of a trade-off!)
- Still need to implement the placeholders that can show up before the card appears. (Makes it so that it looks smoother in case of slow connection).

### #73: Improve Grid View (Aditya, Aldrin, George):
- Implemented a hover animation for when the mouse is hovering over a card, and implemented a search bar to look up cards by professor names.
- Still need to implement a sorting feature (sort cards by name or rarity).
- Also still need to implement the duplicate cards system (if you have multiple of the same card, show a number in a corner of how many of the cards you have.)

### #74: Improve Clicker (Aldrin, Cody, Jao)
- Not much progress done in terms of new change. 
- Main focus should be centering the clicker in the center of the screen, adding small animations to the clicker to make it more lively, and adding small bonuses for interactivity.

### #75: Improving Shop Page (Julia, Richard, and Mei)
- Not much progress done in terms of new change. Main focus is really just making the website look pleasing and fit more with our general theme of UCSD Tritons.

## Additional Progress
Not much in terms of additional progress outside of throwing and brainstorming ideas for QoL features to improve the main components. 

## Final Notes
- 72 and 73 have had decent progress on their tasks, but still need to be finalized. 74 and 75 have yet to be have any efficient implementation.
- Most of our priority for this week was focused on the Midterm and personal events occuring, which lead to a lot less work being done this week's sprint than possible. Next week will be focusing on finalizing our components by making it look appealing and optimized for mobile devices and with adding finishing touches to the features.
