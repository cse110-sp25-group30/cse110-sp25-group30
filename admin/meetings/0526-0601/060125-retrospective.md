## Retrospective Notes

### GLAD (What Went Well?)
- Effective and Transparent communication between team members, whether in-person or asynchronous.
- Proper spread of messages through our main sources of communication (Discord and Slack), ensuring that the TA also sees the signs of progress on the tasks.
- Real-time Screen Sharing between teams led to fast and reliable coding being done with little errors and misunderstandings.
  
### MAD (What Didn't Go Well?)
- The Midterm :(
( On a serious note, the midterm took away a lot of time from working on the project due to our priority for achieveing a good result on it, leading to a lot of time taken away from the project itself.)
- Personal Circumstances leading to issues with not meeting deadlines (Emergency Situations).

  
### SAD (What Could Have Gone Better)
- More time could have been allocated to this week's task, but was not doable due to the main priority of the second midterm for our class, alongside personal events preventing most from working.
- More detailed documentation comments on what each code aspect does.

## Additional Notes
- Have detailed documentation comments and code for future written code, in order to make the JSdoc have detailed and informative documentization of our code.
