- Creating more detailed and early check-in chats related to specific issues or tasks.
- Make more detailed announcements/posts to clarify the scope of the tasks and necessities required from each issue.

### Unanswered Questions?

## Additional Notes
Because of this being the first sprint and our focus is on the MVP, there wasn't much super-detailed to discuss or talk about.
The meetings of the first week basically work as "Templates" for how we expect the following sprints to go, with more detail and focus.
