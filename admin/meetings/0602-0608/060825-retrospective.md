## Retrospective Notes

### GLAD (What Went Well?)
- Effective and Transparent communication between team members, whether in-person or asynchronous.
- Proper spread of messages through our main sources of communication (Discord and Slack), ensuring that the TA also sees the signs of progress on the tasks.
- Real-time Screen Sharing between teams led to fast and reliable coding being done with little errors and misunderstandings.
- Effective Mob Programming (Having several members meet get on call together to work on the finishing touches and details for the project before deadline.)
  
### MAD (What Didn't Go Well?)
- Personal Circumstances leading to issues with not meeting deadlines (Emergency Situations).
- Crunching due to lack of time due to not much progress on the previous sprint week.
- Some ideas not being fully realized due to the deadline.
  
### SAD (What Could Have Gone Better)
- More time could have been allocated to work on the final tasks for the final sprint week.
- Some components could have had a bit more polish and details to make them as nice as they could be.

## Additional Notes
- Documentation and test coverage became efficient and detailed since the previous retrospective, showing improvement in that aspect as a result.
- Thank you to everyone for their contribution throughout this project and our weekly spring! Good luck for the future :)
