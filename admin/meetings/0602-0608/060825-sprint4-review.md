## Task Progress

### #72: Improve Frog-Cards (Jonathan, Cody, Kevin)
- Completed fully, added placeholder text for if the image fails to load.

### #73: Improve Grid View (Aditya, Aldrin, George):
- Fully Completed, added the card duplicate system that shows the amount of duplicate cards you own, as well as the tab that lets you merge multiple cards into one with a popup message in the end.
- Also added a sorting feature by rarity and name of the card.

### #74: Improve Clicker (Aldrin, Cody, Jao)
- Added some bonus ideas to make the clicker more lively (Frenzy component to earn points faster and +10 popup windows to click once and get 10 points.)
- Made the coin look nicer, with added shine and animations for being clicked on and more.

### #75: Improving Shop Page (Julia, Richard, and Mei)
- Fully implemented, smooth animations added of the card package opening and the animation changing based on the rarity of the card.
- Changing the UI of the shop a bit to make it more readable and look nicer together, as well as keeping it consistent with the theme.

### 103: Update Index Page to Main (Terri)
- Removed the Card Deck completely, replaced it with a starting page showing an overview of our team and what the project is, showing cards of the contributors, alongside the trademarks.

## Additional Progress
The header and the entire style of the website has been changed to make sure that all the details are all matching together, and are consistent with each other in fonts and with coloring and styling.
Testing has been pretty much finalized (coverage has reached to 80-90% of the code), with efficient documentation comments added to the code as well.

## Final Notes
- All of our tasks have been completed, and this is officially our last sprint for our group. The video that we will be working on due this Tuesday will include some ideas on what features or aspects could be added to make it even better.
- Thank you to all of the team member for their great contributions :).
