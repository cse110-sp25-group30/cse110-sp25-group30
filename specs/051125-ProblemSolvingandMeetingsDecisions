# ADR1: Decisions Regarding Problem-Solving and Weekly Meetings

## Date: May 11th, 2025. 

## Meetings Decision

According to the team's availabilities using LettuceMeet, we have decided to have 2 weekly meetings throughout the rest of the course:
1. Sprint Start Meeting (1-2 Hours): Spending the time figuring out what components/issues should be worked on, who will work with who and who will work on what component. 
Time: 8:30PM on Mondays.

2. Spring Review (1 Hour, can vary depending on if we want to do extra stuff): Spending the time talking about what we did throughout the week, what was accomplished, what wasn't accomplished, and maybe planning out what we will do for next week in advance to get a small head start.
Time: 8:00PM on Sundays.

- For those who will be unable to meet, we will have documentation notes for each meeting we have, so that for those who cannot attend or are unable to join are still up to date on what we are doing. 

## Problem-Solving Decision

In relation to our Problem-Solving, everyone has agreed to partake in these guidelines:
- Our teams will be Issue-Focused, rather than code-focused. This means that instead of seperating into teams via coding language (HTML, CSS, JS), teams will be created on an Issue/Task Focused environment, in order to avoid the issues that rose during our warm-up activity.
- We will be incorporating a Pairing style, with each team working on an issue/component at hand, using Github Issues as a tool. The teams will have a "Driver" and an "Observer".
- Members will be able to choose what task they want to complete for the week. This means that Pairing will be Promiscous, as it can rotate between team members for each week.

These are the established guidelines we have agreed upon in a meeting, and will be followed throughout the remaining weeks in order to provide an efficient strategy for our project.
