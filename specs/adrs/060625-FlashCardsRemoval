# ADR3: Removal of Card-Deck and Implementing Consistent Presentation.

## Date: June 6th, 2025. 

## Context
Due to not much progress being done during the last sprint, and due to the main focus of our project being more oriented towards the card collector, we have decided to not implement the idea of Flashcards into our project, and just focusing on it being a Card Collector.

## Decisions

### No Flashcard Implementation
Since we do not have much time and resources, we decided the implementation of the flashcards idea is no longer necessary for our project, and priotizing just the card collector aspect to make it as polished as possible should be our main new priority.

## Final Notes
Not many big decisions have really been made through this week's sprint, as we are pretty much in a "wrapping up" phase of just improving our existing components and making them polished and stylish for our project.
