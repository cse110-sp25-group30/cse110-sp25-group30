# ADR3: Removal of Card-Deck and Implementing Consistent Presentation.

## Date: May 28th, 2025. (Once again, was delayed due to personal events, so it was added late.)

## Context
With most of our maing features completed, we have officially agreed to prioritize QoL details and adding consistent presentation throughout the page, while also deciding what to do with the Card Deck.

## Decisions

### Card Deck Removal
With the existence of the Card Grid showing all of the cards you have obtained, we have decided to no longer use the Card Deck, as it is obsolete with the existence of the Grid View. We can:
- Either remove the card deck page completely, making the grid view the main page of the project when you enter for the first time.
- Turn it into a different feature that shows a card you click on in full size and detail, as well as the ability to merge the cards.

### Standardized Presentations
With the theme of our project being about collecting cards of UCSD CSE Professors, we have agreed to make the presentation of our project fit the corresponding style. The ways to do this are:
- Using the Standardized color scheme of UCSD (Shades of Blue, Navy Blue, and Gold colors).
- Using fonts seen throughout the pages of UCSD (Brix Sans, Refrigerator Deluxe, etc.)
- Enhancing the overall presentation of the pages (adding hover animations to the buttons and small assets of the pages.)\

## Final Notes
These are all of the major team decisions that have been made in regards of our current status. After the end of the third sprint, we will be deciding whether or not we should be implementing the flashcards feature we originally had for our main project.
